Title:
Agentic — AI-Based Adaptive Learning Platform for Differently Abled Students

Prompt:
Build a complete Python + Flask (or Streamlit) project that provides an AI-based adaptive learning platform designed specifically for differently abled students. The system should include accessibility features, multimodal AI interaction, adaptive learning logic, and a clean dashboard UI.

1. Project Goals
Create a platform that:

Personalizes learning material based on each student’s ability.

Supports voice, text, sign language detection, and visual interaction.

Adapts difficulty level using reinforcement learning or rule-based logic.

Tracks student behaviour, emotion, progress, and performance.

Provides a simple, accessible web UI.

2. Required System Features
A. Accessibility & Multimodal Input
Implement:

Text-to-Speech (TTS) for visually impaired students

Speech-to-Text (STT) for limited mobility students

Hand gesture recognition for sign-language interpretation using MediaPipe

Simple, accessible UI with large fonts & high contrast

Voice command navigation (basic commands)

Files:

/modules/tts_engine.py
/modules/stt_engine.py
/modules/sign_language_detector.py
B. Adaptive Learning Engine
Analyze student's speed, accuracy, and comprehension

Adjust quiz difficulty automatically

Provide personalized recommendations

Maintain student learning profile

Rule-based + ML-driven adaptation (basic RL or decision tree)

File:
/modules/adaptive_engine.py

C. Content Personalization Layer
Text simplification (shorter sentences)

Multiple content formats: text, audio, visual diagrams

Option to convert lessons to sign language video (placeholder)

Reading-level adjustment (easy, medium, advanced)

File:
/modules/content_personalization.py

D. Emotion & Engagement Detection (Basic)
Use webcam to detect expressions like confusion, engagement, frustration

OpenCV + simple CNN/mediapipe emotion model

Adapt UI/lesson if student looks confused

File:
/modules/emotion_detector.py

E. Learning Analytics & Student Progress
Record quiz results, difficulty changes, time spent

Generate weekly progress report

Store data in JSON or SQLite

Files:

/modules/progress_tracker.py
/database/student_data.db
F. Web Dashboard (Flask or Streamlit)
Features required:

Student login/simple ID selection

Lesson viewer

Quiz section

Progress charts (matplotlib)

Audio mode

Sign language mode

Emotion detection mode

Files:

app.py
/templates/index.html
/templates/lesson.html
/templates/quiz.html
/static/style.css
3. Utilities
/utils/helpers.py
/utils/plot_utils.py
4. Requirements
Generate a requirements.txt with:

flask
opencv-python
mediapipe
tensorflow
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
gTTS
speechrecognition
pyaudio
5. Expected File Structure
main.py
app.py
/modules/tts_engine.py
/modules/stt_engine.py
/modules/sign_language_detector.py
/modules/adaptive_engine.py
/modules/content_personalization.py
/modules/emotion_detector.py
/modules/progress_tracker.py
/utils/helpers.py
/utils/plot_utils.py
/templates/index.html
/templates/lesson.html
/templates/quiz.html
/static/style.css
/database/student_data.db
6. Expected Final Behaviour
Students interact using text, audio, or gestures

Lessons adapt based on performance & behaviour

Platform simplifies content automatically

Progress dashboard visualizes growth

Runs fully inside Replit
